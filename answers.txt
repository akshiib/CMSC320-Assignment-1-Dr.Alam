Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to absolutely any field. Every field
requires data and could be enhanced with data collection and analysis. 
One example is mobile phone stores. They can collect data about who usually
uses their phones, the age-group, the profession, etc. Based on that they 
can sell to their target audience. Another example is healthcare, where they
can collect and study data to understand trends for better and early diagnosis.
