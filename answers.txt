Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git is very useful for version control. It stores history of every
change you push. Thus, if you make changes you don't want and want to 
revert, Git makes this very easy.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to absolutely any field. Every field
requires data and could be enhanced with data collection and analysis. 
One example is mobile phone stores. They can collect data about who usually
uses their phones, the age-group, the profession, etc. Based on that they 
can sell to their target audience. Another example is healthcare, where they
can collect and study data to understand trends for better and early diagnosis.


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging takes changes from one branch and tries to integrate them
into another branch. It also creates a merge commit. This way, we retain the
history of what we developed where. Rebasing, on the other hand, reapplies
the commit from one branch to the other. It rewrites the commit history. The
advantage is that the commit history is linear and thus cleaner. The 
disadvantage is the change in the commit history, which can make
things confusing.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I want to learn how to conduct an exploratory data analysis.
I also often struggle with finding good sources of data for data collection
purposes. Those are the skills I hope to improve.
